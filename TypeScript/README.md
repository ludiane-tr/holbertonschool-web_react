# 📘 Holberton School - TypeScript Modules

This project is part of the **Web React** curriculum at Holberton School. It includes a series of exercises to get familiar with **TypeScript**, best practices, project setup using **Webpack**, and concepts like **namespaces**, **interfaces**, **inheritance**, and **nominal typing** (e.g., branded types).

## 📁 Project Structure

Each `task_x` folder contains a specific exercise:

- `task_0`: Getting started with TypeScript – setup and simple functions
- `task_1`: Working with interfaces
- `task_2`: Classes, inheritance, and interface implementation
- `task_3`: Advanced types and the `Student` interface
- `task_4`: Namespaces, declaration merging, and subject/teacher logic
- `task_5`: Nominal typing using branded types (`MajorCredits`, `MinorCredits`)

## ▶️ Run the Project

To compile and bundle a task using Webpack:

cd task_X
npm install
npx webpack
